# Node.js API

This app is a quick and simple demo of a Node.js API backend, using Express.js and MonogoDB, and RESTful routes.

To run, download and npm install dependencies & run 'npm run dev'.

Use Postman to send http requests, using key-values in the request body (select 'x-www-form-urlencoded').

This app has four RESTful routes: 

* CREATE: to create a note
* READ (SHOW): to read a note
* UPDATE: to update a note
* DELETE: to delete a note

For example, to READ a note, browse to: localhost:8000/notes/{the id of note}
